# Create your own theme for ggplot!
#   In principle you should use this ggplot theme in the remainder of the course for assignments ect.
#   Of course you can change along, but I would like to encourage all of you to use a personalized theme!
#
#  !! Please RENAME this file and call it accordingly in the runfile !! 
#
#   To get 7 points you will need to modify at least 7 parameters of the theme_classic or theme_bw!
