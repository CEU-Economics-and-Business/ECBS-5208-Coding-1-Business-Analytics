How to get the
share-health dataset

used in case study 11A Does smoking pose a health risk?


****************************************************************
Data source

Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)
http://www.share-project.org/home0.html

easySHARE dataset, release 6.0.0
http://www.share-project.org/special-data-sets/easyshare.html
(you may receive access to a more recent easySHARE version;
that's fine as it should contain all observations and variables 
in the 6.0.0 release, adding some more)

!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!
Acces to the SHARE data means that you can use the data for your education. 
Nobody can distribute the original SHARE data or any data derived from it.
Therefore, we don't include it in our data_repo, 
neither the raw data nor the tidy data.
We distribute the code that cleans the data so you can create it for yourself.

Teachers & Instructors - to speed up for classes

****************************************************************

If you are a teacher/instructor and use this textbook in the classroom, there is a way to speed up the process. 
The simplified approach provides 'teachers' with a way of help registering course participants as regular SHARE users at the same time and allows them to distribute the easySHARE data set to their 'students'. 
IMPORTANT: This doesn't substitute for students' individual registrations. Each student needs to send their individual applications even if they are on the teacher's list. This extra step helps the quick and successful registration of the students.

1. As a teacher, please follow the steps for individuals first. You gain access and login name. 

2. Collect names and email addresses of students. 

3. Fill out and sign the easySHARE Teacher Statement (PDF) - including student information
http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/easySHARE_Teacher_Statement.pdf

You may also collect student information in a spreadsheet (last name, first name, email) and send it attached. 
This helps administartors assign student access quickly. 
    
4. Print, sign and submit the completed and signed Statement(s) to the SHARE Research Data Center:

SHARE Research Data Center
Email:  share-rdc@uvt.nl

5. IMPORTANTLY: All students HAVE TO to fill in the individual form themselves (http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/SHARE_Data_Statement.pdf) - as described above and send it back. 
Teachers will ideally collect them and send it back in pacakge. Students will then get individual access. 

Note that you may store the data on your computer or share it with your students who registered, but you cannot not share it with anyone else.
