# In this assignment we are interested if 
# Males go more frequently to doctors than females. In order to answer this question we do an analysis on
#   a cross-section data originating from the 1977â€“1978 Australian Health Survey.

# 0) Clear work space


# 1) Load tidyverse and modelsummary packages and install and load the "AER" package


# Load the data of doctor visits from AER package (more info: https://rdrr.io/cran/AER/man/DoctorVisits.html)
data("DoctorVisits")

df <- DoctorVisits
rm( DoctorVisits )

# 2) Make a quick data summary on all the variables


# 3) Make descriptive statistics on the variable visits conditional on the gender


# 4) Create a ggplot where you display the conditional distributions of visits given the gender


# 5-6) Would you consider this a useful graph? Use instead a stacked bar graph!
#   a) create a new tibble, which groups by gender and visits and count the cases (summarise)
#   b) create a ggplot using aux with the geometry: geom_bar. 
#       You should specify the following arguments: stat = "identity", position = "fill"



# 7) Test whether the number of visits are the same for male and female
#   Hint: check the t.test function and use `~` sign to define the two groups.
#   You should have a Welch-Two Sample t-test and its results.
